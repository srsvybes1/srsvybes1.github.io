So far in my journey using Learn to advance my knowledge, I've learned that in fact i have a long way to go still if that makes sense. With my back knowledge i thought that this would be way easier than it currently is for me. I will admit that ive had to unlearn a lot of the bad habits I picked up from coding in college. This journey will be a very fufilling one at the end, but for right now i have to buckle down tighter and focus more. The lessons are easy, just sometimes a tad bit confusing. But I'm getting the hang of it.
