Due to the nba being closed down i decided to dedicate my CLI project to extracting information about my two favrotie nba teams. The Knicks, and the bulls. I want to add onto the project by extracting the bulls players by years. Meaning that i could type in 1992 bulls and find the players of that year and so on. The most challenging part about the project was just finding the correct html code to scrape off the website, it took hours of trial and error and help from my cohort lead. All in all the project was a sucess as i was able to extract the information i wanted to display.
